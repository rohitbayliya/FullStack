// The time complexity of Array.prototype.splice() in the worst case is O(n), 
// where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because, in the 
// worst-case scenario, the operation may need to shift all elements in the 
// array to accommodate the removal or insertion of elements.
//  For example, if elements are removed or added at the beginning of the array,
//  every subsequent element must be reindexed, leading to a linear time complexity.
