    <h1>My Favorite Hobbies: Gaming & Anime</h1>

    <h2>Why I Love Gaming</h2>
    <p><b>Gaming</b> is one of my favorite ways to relax and have fun. It allows me to dive into exciting virtual worlds and test my skills against other players. Gaming is not just entertainment—it's a way to connect with friends, build strategies, and improve mental focus.</p>
    <p>Among all the games I’ve tried, <b><i>Free Fire</i></b> stands out the most. It’s an intense battle royale game where players drop onto an island and fight to survive. The fast-paced gameplay, character abilities, and variety of weapons keep it <u>fresh and engaging</u> every time I play.</p>

    <h2>Why I Love Anime</h2>
    <p><i>Anime</i> is another hobby that I truly enjoy. It’s a form of storytelling that combines amazing visuals, emotional depth, and meaningful messages. Watching anime inspires me and teaches life lessons through exciting characters and unique plots.</p>
    <p>Some of my favorite anime include <b>Naruto</b>, <b>Demon Slayer</b>, and <b>Castlevania</b>. Each of these shows has powerful storylines, intense battles, and characters that I deeply connect with. <u>Anime is more than just entertainment</u>—it’s a source of creativity, motivation, and emotion for me.</p>
